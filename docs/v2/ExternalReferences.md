### Polygon

A polygon contains an array of rings or curveRings and a spatialReference. For polygons with curveRings, see the sections on JSON curve object and Polygon with curve.

An empty polygon is represented with an empty array for the rings field. Nulls and/or NaNs embedded in an otherwise defined coordinate stream for polylines/polygons is a syntax error.

Polygons should be topologically simple. Exterior rings are oriented clockwise, while holes are oriented counter-clockwise. Rings can touch at a vertex or self-touch at a vertex, but there should be no other intersections. Polygons returned by services are topologically simple.

When drawing a polygon, use the even-odd fill rule. The even-odd fill rule will guarantee that the polygon will draw correctly even if the ring orientation is not as described above.

The length of these tangent lines and position of the control points determines the shape of the created bézier curve.
